					<h2><a href="https://github.com/mozilla-services/dependency-observatory-research/tree/master/alex-bellon-internship">Security Engineering Intern</a></h2>
					<p>[Summer 2020] As part of the Firefox Operations Security team, I worked on Dependency Observatory, a tool that allows developers to check how secure an NPM package is before using it in their project. I researched how vulnerable top packages in NPM, PyPI and Cargo are to attack, and used those findings to tweak the algorithm used to "score" packages' safety in Dependency Observatory. I worked with Python, k8s, Docker, Flask, and GraphQL.</p>

					<h2><a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/">Undergraduate TA (CS361)</a></h2>
					<p>[Dec 2018 - Dec 2019] As a TA for CS361 Intro to Security, I created and graded security-focused assignments for 80+ students, lectured on various topics in security like ​cryptography​ and ​forensics​, and held office hours every week. I also wrote and ran a Capture the Flag (CTF) competition that was used for the students' final exam last semester.</p>

					<h2><a href="https://www.ea.com/">Security Analyst Intern</a></h2>
					<p>[Summer 2019] As part of the Enterprise Security team, I wrote programs in ​Python​ to automate validating the results from CASB scans. The programs conduct port scans and send GET/HEAD requests to cloud service instances, then export the results to a JSON file, Google Sheet and MySQL database. It also sent out emails to the owner of those accounts to share and explain the findings. I also created a dynamic warning page to place in front of non-approved websites as categorized by the firewall.</p>

					<p>[May 2018 - May 2019] Code Ninjas is an after school and summer program that teaches 7-14 year old children how to code. During the school year, students progress through "belts" on a 4 year curriculum path and during the summer we offer week long camps focusing on anything from Scratch to Minecraft to drones. As a "Code Sensei", I am in charge of teaching the children during class and camps.</p>

					<p>[Jul 2016 - Jan 2018] American Robotics Academy is a LEGO Robotics camp held during spring, summer and winter breaks for students ages 5-12. The students spend the week building robots and machines that fit into that week's theme. As an instructor, I am in charge of teaching the children how to build the robots, and keeping an eye on them during break times. I also help oversee check-in and check-out of students at the beginning and end of the day.</p>

					<h2><a href="https://nas.okstate.edu/has/">H.S. Aerospace Scholar</a></h2>
					<p>[Aug 2016] I participated in a program through NASA's JSC in which high school students are enrolled in a 4 month online course concerning all aspects of STEM. The students with the highest grades in the online course are invited to a week long internship program at NASA's JSC. I was one of the students who made it to the "on-site experience", where we worked in teams of 11 to plan a mission to Mars, including mocking up rovers, landers and other research vehicles.</p>
