at the time i write this there are three comments asking what ha will do for you.
</p>

<p>
the short answer is that it will bridge all your technologies together and allow a ridiculous level of automation between them. \"all\" your technologies? well at the time of this writing [only 1524 of them i guess&#x2026;](<a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations">https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations</a>)

here's some screenshots of my ui: <a href="https://imgur.com/a/mdisrnt">https://imgur.com/a/mdisrnt</a> that floorplan has actual buttons i can interact with to control lights, thermostats, media players, doors, fans. our cars grey out when one of us is gone&#x2013;[here's the green car gone](<img src="https://i.imgur.com/pdtihoq.png" alt="pdtihoq.png" />). doors turn red when open, [example](<img src="https://i.imgur.com/rd6qz5u.png" alt="rd6qz5u.png" />). though i find if i'm spending time in my ui it means my automations should be better. as i get better at writing rules so the house works for me i'm spending less and less time in the ui controlling things.
