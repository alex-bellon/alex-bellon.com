          <h2><a href="https://isss.io">hash association of security hackers</a></h2>
          <p>I was a member of HASH (the HASH Association of Security Hackers), which was the overarching organization for competitive security at UT Austin. We competed in the <a href="https://www.nationalccdc.org/">Collegiate Cybersecurity Defense Competition (CCDC)</a> and the <a href="https://cp.tc/">Collegiate Penetration Testing Competition (CPTC)</a>. I served as captain of both the CCDC (2020, 2021) and CPTC (2019, 2020) teams. In CPTC, we placed 2nd at the <a href="https://cp.tc/new-england">New England Regionals</a> in 2019. In CCDC, we placed 2nd in 2019 and 3rd in 2020 at the <a href="https://southwestccdc.com/about/">Southwest Regional</a>; in 2021 we won the Southwest Regional and competed at Nationals for the first time in school history!</p>

					<h2><a href="https://www.isss.io/">information & systems security society</a></h2>
					<p>I was President of the Information & System Security Society, a club dedicated to cybersecurity, from spring 2020 to spring 2021. Before that, I served as an engineering officer for 2 years. I wrote problems and challenges for the CTFs we held every two weeks, and gave talks about introductory security topics. I managed an officer team of 15, and we had 100+ members. We also held a yearly international CTF called UTCTF that had 1200+ competitors from all over the globe (I lead this project in 2020 and 2021). </p>

					<h2><a href="https://texasacm.org/">association for computing machinery</a></h2>
					<p>For 2 years, I served as a Web/Tech office for UT's Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) chapter. I kept the <a href="https://texasacm.org">TexasACM.org</a> website up to date and free of bugs, responded to issues on our GitHub page, and maintained the GitHub Wiki. I also created, wrote curriculum for and hosted a series of <a href="https://github.com/UTACM/CS101">introductory workshops</a> for new CS majors to introduce them to topics like Linux, Git/VCS, debugging, and more.</p>

We finished in the top 3 at multiple competitions, and we even took home the grand prize at TAMUhack 2019. Besides Hackathons, we also particpated in CTFs and Programming Competitions.</p>

					<h2><a href="https://www.facebook.com/TexasQuidditch/">austin quidditch</a></h2>
					<p>For 2 years, I played on one of UT's club Quidditch teams, and yes, I mean the sport from Harry Potter. It's a co-ed, full contact sport played against other colleges and universities in the US Quidditch League. If you're wondering, I was primarily a Chaser and occasionally played Seeker.</p>
