          <h2><a href="https://www.nationalccdc.org/">CCDC</a></h2>
          <p>I was the captain of UT's Collegiate Cybersecurity Defense Competition (CCDC) team for 2020 and 2021. In CCDC, teams of 8 students must defend 8-10 machines from red team attackers while also completing business 'injects' (like setting up new services, managing users, etc.). As captain, I delegated tasks and worked on any extra technical or business injects that need help. At the Southwest Regional we placed 2nd in 2019 and 3rd in 2020 place; in 2021 we won the Southwest Regional and competed at Nationals for the first time!</p>

					<h2><a href="https://nationalcptc.org/">CPTC</a></h2>
					<p>I was the captain of UT's Collegiate Penetration Testing Competition (CPTC) team for 2020 and co-captain in 2019. CPTC is a competition where teams of 6 students are tasked with performing a comprehensive penetration test for a fake company, and then delivering a detailed report of the vulnerabilities and security flaws they found. In 2019, we placed 2nd at the New England Regionals.</p>

					<h2><a href="https://www.isss.io/">ISSS</a></h2>
					<p>I was President of the Information & System Security Society, a club dedicated to cybersecurity, from spring 2020 to spring 2021. Before that, I served as an engineering officer for 2 years. I wrote problems and challenges for the CTFs we held every two weeks, and gave talks about introductory security topics. I managed an officer team of 15, and we had 100+ members. We also held a yearly international CTF called UTCTF that had 1200+ competitors from all over the globe (I lead this project in 2020 and 2021). </p>

					<h2><a href="https://texasacm.org/">ACM</a></h2>
					<p>For 2 years, I served as a Web/Tech office for UT's Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) chapter. I kept the <a href="https://texasacm.org">TexasACM.org</a> website up to date and free of bugs, responded to issues on our GitHub page, and maintained the GitHub Wiki. I also created, wrote curriculum for and hosted a series of <a href="https://github.com/UTACM/CS101">introductory workshops</a> for new CS majors to introduce them to topics like Linux, Git/VCS, debugging, and more.</p>

					<p>I was one of the co-founders of a hackathon team called 'The Waitlisters'. Started at HackTX 2017, we particpated in dozens of hackathons across the US. We finished in the top 3 at multiple competitions, and we even took home the grand prize at TAMUhack 2019. Besides Hackathons, we also particpated in CTFs and Programming Competitions.</p>

					<p>For 2 years, I played on one of UT's club Quidditch teams, and yes, I mean the sport from Harry Potter! It's a competitive team that plays against other colleges and universities in the US Quidditch League. If you're wondering, I was primarily a Chaser and occasionally played Seeker.</p>
