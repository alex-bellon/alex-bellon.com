#+HTML: <div class="intro">
*I am a third year PhD student in the CSE department at UC San Diego, advised by [[https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~dstefan/][Deian Stefan]] and [[https://patpannuto.com/][Pat Pannuto]].* I'm primarily interested in the security of high risk systems and embedded devices. My research is partially supported by a [[https://grad.ucsd.edu/diversity/programs-resources/diversity-resources/sdf-cr-fellowships.html][San Diego Fellowship]].

I graduated from UT Austin in 2021 with degrees in CS and Mathematics, where I was very involved in the security community. I served as president of UT's cybersecurity organization, [[https://www.isss.io/][Information and Systems Society (ISSS)]], and also captained UT's [[https://www.nationalccdc.org/][Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition (CCDC)]] and [[https://nationalcptc.org/][Collegiate Penetration Testing Competition (CPTC)]] teams.

I used to serve as the VP of Web/Tech for [[https://www.texasacm.org/][UT's ACM chapter]], where I started [[https://github.com/UTACM/CS101][mulitple]] [[https://github.com/UTACM/Web-Workshop][different]] [[https://www.texasacm.org/AtoZ][initiatives]] to make computer science more accessible. I also used to attend a lot of [[https://devpost.com/alex-bellon][hackathons]].
