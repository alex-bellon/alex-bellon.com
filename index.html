			<p>I am primarily interested in cybersecurity, privacy and open source. I recently graduated from UT Austin with degree in CS and Mathematics, where I was very involved in the security community. I served as president of UT's cybersecurity organization, <a href='https://www.isss.io/'>Information and Systems Society (ISSS)</a>, where I wrote CTF challenges for the bi-weekly CTFs that we hosted. As captain of UT's <a href='https://www.nationalccdc.org/'>Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition (CCDC)</a> and <a href='https://nationalcptc.org/'>Collegiate Penetration Testing Competition (CPTC)</a> teams, I competed as part of the blue and red teams to secure services and machines in a simulated environment. I also used to TA for CS361: Introduction to Security and CS349: Contemporary Issues in Computer Science. </p>
			<p>In terms of software development, for 2 years I did frontend work as the VP Webmaster for UT's chapter of ACM, and as one of the Webmasters for <a href="http://waitlisters.org">'The Waitlisters'</a>. As part of the Waitlisters, I also attended lots of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon">hackathons</a> where I did backend work for webapps, usually working in Python and SQL.</p>
			<p> Outside of computer science, I like to do graphic design and photography to keep creative and take breaks from coding. I also enjoy the performing arts, and went to see every Broadway show that came to UT at the Bass Concert Hall (before COVID :( ). I also used to play Quidditch (yes really) for UT's club team! </p>
