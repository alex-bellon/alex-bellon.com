                    <p>UTCTF is the international 48-hour we (<a href="https://isss.io">ISSS</a>) host every year. In 2021 and 2020 I led the project, coordinating the event planning, communication channels, prizes, etc. in addition to writing challenges for the CTF as part of my engineering officer duties. For UTCTF 2020 we had over <b><i>2500 users registered between 1300+ teams</i></b>. In 2019 I wrote cryptography, forensics and miscellaneous challenges for the CTF.</p>

					<p>AllerGen allows you to create a profile with a list of things you are allergic to. You can then scan foods, and it will show the ingredient list and determine whether or not you are allergic to it. You can also create a list of foods and then find the common ingredients to see which ingredient is causing the allergic reaction.</p>
					<br>
					<p>This project was made for TAMUhack 2019. I worked on the backend in Python, sending requests to the USDA's API to search and get info, as well as implement the logic compare ingredients to the allergen list or to each other.</p>
